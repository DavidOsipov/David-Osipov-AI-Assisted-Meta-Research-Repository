# David Osipov's AI-Assisted Meta-Research Repository

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I'm David Osipov, a Product Manager with a passion for cybersecurity, AI, and open knowledge. This repository hosts meta-research projects â€“ critical reviews and syntheses of scientific literature on various topics, often created through a collaboration between human expertise and artificial intelligence.

## About This Repository

The goal here is to explore complex topics by leveraging AI for initial information gathering and synthesis, followed by rigorous human review, validation, structuring, and critical analysis by me. You'll find synthesized research papers, literature reviews, and analyses on subjects primarily within environmental health, toxicology, cybersecurity, AI ethics, and potentially other areas I delve into.

## Methodology & Disclaimer

The research papers here are generated using a combination of state-of-the-art AI models (like Gemini, Claude, Grok, etc.) for initial drafting and literature searching, followed by my own critical assessment, fact-checking (using tools like Google Scholar and direct source review where possible), synthesis, editing, and formatting.

**Disclaimer:** While significant effort is made to ensure the accuracy, coherence, and proper citation of the information presented, these papers represent a synthesis based on AI-retrieved and human-curated sources. They are intended for informational and educational purposes. Always consult the primary source materials and conduct independent verification for critical applications or decisions. The AI components may occasionally introduce errors or misinterpretations despite the review process.
